For training Your own handwriting validation model: 
1.Open the cont_val.ipynb notebook file in any IDE (Jupyter,Vscode etc).
1.Make sure you have your image datasets organized in folders based on their classes ("valid" and "invalid"and "zoomed").
2.If using a PDF for image extraction, ensure it is in the specified location (pdf_file_path).
3.Run data loading part directly if augmentation is not required and ensure your desired parameters are set as hyperparameters.
4.Follow through till the model architecture block where you can experiment with the model parameters for fine tuning.("not necessary")
5.run (model.fit) block to start training your own model and save it using (model.save) block.
6.The model will be trained on number of epochs (iterations).

For Testing the trained model:
1.Open cont_val.ipynb file
2.Direct to the 37th block of notebook named Testing.
3.Inside the python line (test = cv2.imread('valid_test_3.jpg')) replace the file name with the path of your test image and run the block
4.On loading the trained model() using (model = load_model('model.h5')) change the name to the path of your downloaded or saved model file
5.Run the blocks till 44th block of the notebook to obtain your output.

For Explainability:
1.Run all the test blocks prior to explainability code
2.Execute all blocks till block 61 to obtain visual representations of test image of why the model predicted the image to a specific class
